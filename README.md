## Overview

This repository contains solutions to **LeetCode Medium** level problems, implemented using Python and organized in Jupyter notebooks. The goal is to practice problem-solving and enhance coding skills in a structured way. Each notebook provides a clear explanation, code implementation, and some test cases to verify the solution.

## Repository Structure

- **Problem Solutions**: Each LeetCode problem is solved in its dedicated Jupyter notebook. The notebooks are organized by problem number and name.
- **Code**: Python 3 is used for all implementations.
- **Tests**: Basic test cases are provided at the end of each notebook to demonstrate the correctness of the solution.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KirtiPratihar/LEETCODE-MEDIUM-SOLUTIONS.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd leetcode-medium-solutions
3. Install necessary dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
5. Choose a notebook from the list and run it to see the solution and test cases.

Sample Problem
Each problem notebook includes the following sections:

**Problem Description: A brief description of the LeetCode problem (with the link to the problem).**
**Approach:** Explanation of the chosen approach to solve the problem.
**Code:** Python implementation of the solution.
**Test Cases:** A few test cases used to verify the correctness of the solution.
